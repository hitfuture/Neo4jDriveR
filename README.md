# Neo4jDriveR
Neo4j Bolt Driver for the Language R

Neo4j is one of the most productive and valuable graph databases available in the industry.  Neo4j has been extended to support graph analytics in a scallable fashion.  This package is based on the official Neo4j Python driver found on the [Github site](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver)

## Installing the package
 
Latest development version from GitHub:

```R
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("hitfuture/Neo4jDriveR")
```
This package will eventually be installed on CRAN and the installation process will be documented when it is available.

## Getting started
Using the Neo4j graph database in the language R has been possible since 2015.  I have posted an article about why we need to try a new method of accessing Neo4j through R at the following site: [HIT Future Now](https://www.hitfuturenow.com/blog/2018/05/17/2018-05-14-leveraging-python-in-r-to-access-the-bolt-protocol-of-neo4j/).  The main reason to put this package out is so that we have a stable and supported version on the Bolt protocol for Neo4j which enables secure and sustainable solutions for the Enterprise.
